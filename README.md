# FacebookClone

Created a React Facebook Clone from a series of tutorials from Clever Programmer in Youtube.

My objective is to learn React alongside creating fun and interesting existing Aplications.

On this one i used:

React. React Hooks & Components.
The only thing working are the comments and the url for images. 
Used Firebase for Auth with Gmail and keeping the props from the user (image and name) in the usual profile information in Facebook. 
Firebase to keep the comments and make them update automatically.
